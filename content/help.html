        <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
        Copy challenges from Apex, include star value for each.<br/>
        Hotkey N will add a new challenge, pressing Enter while editing will save the challenge.<br/>
        When adding a new challenge, the first number entered will be placed in the max value box, 
        if no other number has been entered already.<br/>
        The search icon opens a filter panel, which will search all entered challenges. 
        Text after a comma will be filtered as Modes. Ex: "Bloodhound, BR" shows all challenges with
        Bloodhound and the BR mode.
